# Segmenting the custoers into three distinct groups so better marketing largeted add can launch.




## Overview

Marketing campaign goes wrong if targeted customers did not choose properly.
This model predict  right customers by separating them three distinct groups.
This is an Unsupervised learning technique build on to scikitlearn using
Kmeans algorithm and used PCA as well fro dimension reduction.For comparing
model performance also buld deep learning model on top of Keras using AUTOENCODERS architecture.
